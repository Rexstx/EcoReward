# EcoReward üå±

A blockchain-based sustainability incentive platform that rewards users for eco-friendly actions, tracks environmental impact, and issues NFT certificates for significant milestones.

## Overview

EcoReward is a Clarity smart contract built on the Stacks blockchain that gamifies environmental responsibility by rewarding users with ECO tokens for verified eco-friendly actions. The platform creates a transparent, decentralized system for tracking and incentivizing positive environmental behavior, now enhanced with unique NFT certificates for milestone achievements.

## Features

- **Token-Based Rewards**: Earn ECO tokens for verified eco-friendly actions
- **Impact Tracking**: Track personal and collective environmental impact scores
- **NFT Certificates**: Receive unique certificates for reaching environmental milestones
- **Verified Actions**: Decentralized verification system with authorized verifiers
- **Multiple Action Types**: Support for various eco-friendly activities (recycling, tree planting, solar energy, etc.)
- **User Statistics**: Comprehensive tracking of user participation and rewards
- **Milestone System**: Achievement-based progression with certificate rewards
- **Transparent Governance**: On-chain action type management and reward calculations

## How It Works

1. **Submit Action**: Users submit eco-friendly actions with impact scores
2. **Verification**: Authorized verifiers confirm the authenticity of actions
3. **Reward Distribution**: Verified actions automatically trigger token rewards
4. **Impact Tracking**: System tracks cumulative environmental impact
5. **Milestone Achievement**: Users earn NFT certificates for reaching significant milestones

## Action Types

- **Recycling**: Base reward 100 ECO, 2x impact multiplier
- **Tree Planting**: Base reward 500 ECO, 10x impact multiplier
- **Solar Energy**: Base reward 300 ECO, 5x impact multiplier
- **Bike Commuting**: Base reward 50 ECO, 1x impact multiplier

(contract-call? .ecoreward initialize-action-types)

;; Submit an eco action
(contract-call? .ecoreward submit-eco-action "recycling" u10)

;; Verify an action (verifier only)
(contract-call? .ecoreward verify-eco-action u1)

;; Claim milestone certificate
(contract-call? .ecoreward claim-certificate "eco-warrior")

;; Check balance
(contract-call? .ecoreward get-balance-of tx-sender)

;; Check certificate status
(contract-call? .ecoreward has-certificate tx-sender "eco-warrior")
```
