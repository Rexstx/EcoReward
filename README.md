# EcoReward üå±

A blockchain-based sustainability incentive platform that rewards users for eco-friendly actions and tracks environmental impact.

## Overview

EcoReward is a Clarity smart contract built on the Stacks blockchain that gamifies environmental responsibility by rewarding users with ECO tokens for verified eco-friendly actions. The platform creates a transparent, decentralized system for tracking and incentivizing positive environmental behavior.

## Features

- **Token-Based Rewards**: Earn ECO tokens for verified eco-friendly actions
- **Impact Tracking**: Track personal and collective environmental impact scores
- **Verified Actions**: Decentralized verification system with authorized verifiers
- **Multiple Action Types**: Support for various eco-friendly activities (recycling, tree planting, solar energy, etc.)
- **User Statistics**: Comprehensive tracking of user participation and rewards
- **Transparent Governance**: On-chain action type management and reward calculations

## How It Works

1. **Submit Action**: Users submit eco-friendly actions with impact scores
2. **Verification**: Authorized verifiers confirm the authenticity of actions
3. **Reward Distribution**: Verified actions automatically trigger token rewards
4. **Impact Tracking**: System tracks cumulative environmental impact

## Action Types

- **Recycling**: Base reward 100 ECO, 2x impact multiplier
- **Tree Planting**: Base reward 500 ECO, 10x impact multiplier
- **Solar Energy**: Base reward 300 ECO, 5x impact multiplier
- **Bike Commuting**: Base reward 50 ECO, 1x impact multiplier
- **Composting**: Base reward 75 ECO, 2x impact multiplier

## Technical Specifications

- **Token**: ECO (EcoReward Token)
- **Decimals**: 6
- **Blockchain**: Stacks
- **Language**: Clarity
- **Architecture**: Single contract with comprehensive state management

(contract-call? .ecoreward initialize-action-types)

;; Submit an eco action
(contract-call? .ecoreward submit-eco-action "recycling" u10)

;; Verify an action (verifier only)
(contract-call? .ecoreward verify-eco-action u1)

;; Check balance
(contract-call? .ecoreward get-balance-of tx-sender)
```
